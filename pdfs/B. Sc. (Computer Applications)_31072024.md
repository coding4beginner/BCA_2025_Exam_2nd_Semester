 Preamble  
 
The field of computing is rapidly expanding and changing, especially, since the last decade with  
continuous emergence of new disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, data science,  cyber 
security,  Internet  of things,  robotics  and so on. 
21st Century  has witnessed  rapid  technological  developments  in every  sector  including  the field  
of Computing.  Moreover,  it has created  new  job roles  and massive  job opportunities for  budding

degree  programmes  as per the trends  from  time  to time.  In the year  1989,   it started offering a degree 
programme Bachelor  of Computer  Science  (BCS),  now  called  B. Sc. (Computer  Science)  and was its 
unique  offering  in the state  of Maharashtra. Later the University offered undergraduate and graduate 
programmes such as Master of Comp uter Management (MCM), Bachelor of Computer Applications 
(BCA), Master of Computer Applications (MCA), M. Sc (Computer Science), M. Sc. (Computer
