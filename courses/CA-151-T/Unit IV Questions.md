# Unit IV: Structures - Questions and Answers

## Question 1: What is a structure in C?
**Answer:**  
A structure in C is a user-defined data type that groups related variables of different data types under one name.

---

## Question 2: How do you declare a structure in C?
**Answer:**  
You use the `struct` keyword. Example:
```c
struct Student {
    int id;
    char name[50];
    float marks;
};
```

---

## Question 3: How do you define a structure variable?
**Answer:**  
You define a structure variable by specifying the structure name. Example:
```c
struct Student s1;
```

---

## Question 4: How do you initialize a structure variable?
**Answer:**  
You initialize a structure variable using curly braces. Example:
```c
struct Student s1 = {1, "John", 85.5};
```

---

## Question 5: How do you access structure members?
**Answer:**  
You use the dot operator (`.`). Example:
```c
printf("ID: %d\n", s1.id);
```

---

## Question 6: What is an array of structures?
**Answer:**  
An array of structures is a collection of structure variables. Example:
```c
struct Student students[10];
```

---

## Question 7: How do you access elements in an array of structures?
**Answer:**  
You use the array index and the dot operator. Example:
```c
students[0].id = 1;
```

---

## Question 8: What is a pointer to a structure?
**Answer:**  
A pointer to a structure stores the address of a structure variable. Example:
```c
struct Student *ptr = &s1;
```

---

## Question 9: How do you access structure members using a pointer?
**Answer:**  
You use the arrow operator (`->`). Example:
```c
printf("ID: %d\n", ptr->id);
```

---

## Question 10: How do you pass a structure to a function?
**Answer:**  
You can pass a structure by value or by reference. Example:
```c
void display(struct Student s);
void display(struct Student *s);
```

---

## Question 11: What is the difference between passing a structure by value and by reference?
**Answer:**  
- By value: A copy of the structure is passed.
- By reference: The address of the structure is passed, allowing modifications.

---

## Question 12: How do you return a structure from a function?
**Answer:**  
You specify the structure type as the return type. Example:
```c
struct Student createStudent();
```

---

## Question 13: What is a nested structure?
**Answer:**  
A nested structure is a structure that contains another structure as a member. Example:
```c
struct Address {
    char city[50];
    char state[50];
};

struct Student {
    int id;
    struct Address addr;
};
```

---

## Question 14: How do you access members of a nested structure?
**Answer:**  
You use the dot operator for each level. Example:
```c
printf("City: %s\n", s1.addr.city);
```

---

## Question 15: What is the `typedef` keyword in C?
**Answer:**  
The `typedef` keyword creates an alias for a data type. Example:
```c
typedef struct Student Student;
```

---

## Question 16: How do you use `typedef` with structures?
**Answer:**  
You can simplify structure declarations. Example:
```c
typedef struct {
    int id;
    char name[50];
} Student;
Student s1;
```

---

## Question 17: What is a union in C?
**Answer:**  
A union is a user-defined data type where all members share the same memory location.

---

## Question 18: How is a union different from a structure?
**Answer:**  
In a structure, each member has its own memory, while in a union, all members share the same memory.

---

## Question 19: How do you declare a union in C?
**Answer:**  
You use the `union` keyword. Example:
```c
union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
};
```

---

## Question 20: How do you access members of a union?
**Answer:**  
You use the dot operator. Example:
```c
union Data d;
d.i = 10;
```

---

## Question 21: What is the size of a union?
**Answer:**  
The size of a union is equal to the size of its largest member.

---

## Question 22: What is the purpose of a union?
**Answer:**  
A union is used to save memory when only one member is needed at a time.

---

## Question 23: How do you use a pointer to a union?
**Answer:**  
You use the arrow operator to access members. Example:
```c
union Data *ptr = &d;
ptr->i = 10;
```

---

## Question 24: Can a structure contain a union?
**Answer:**  
Yes, a structure can contain a union as a member.

---

## Question 25: Can a union contain a structure?
**Answer:**  
Yes, a union can contain a structure as a member.

---

## Question 26: What is the purpose of the `sizeof` operator with structures?
**Answer:**  
The `sizeof` operator returns the total memory occupied by a structure.

---

## Question 27: How is memory alignment handled in structures?
**Answer:**  
Memory alignment ensures that structure members are stored at memory addresses that are multiples of their size.

---

## Question 28: What is padding in structures?
**Answer:**  
Padding is extra memory added between structure members to align them properly.

---

## Question 29: How do you minimize padding in structures?
**Answer:**  
You can reorder members or use `#pragma pack` to minimize padding.

---

## Question 30: What is a self-referential structure?
**Answer:**  
A self-referential structure contains a pointer to the same structure type. Example:
```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};
```

---

## Question 31: How do you create a linked list using structures?
**Answer:**  
You use a self-referential structure to create nodes and link them.

**Answer:**  
You use `free`. Example:
```c
free(s);
```

---

## Question 34: What is the purpose of the `const` keyword with structures?
**Answer:**  
The `const` keyword prevents modification of structure members.

---

```c
struct Flags {
    unsigned int flag1 : 1;
    unsigned int flag2 : 1;
};
```

---

## Question 45: What is the purpose of bit fields in structures?
**Answer:**  
Bit fields are used to save memory when storing flags or small values.

---

## Question 46: How do you serialize a structure?
**Answer:**  
You write the structure's data to a file in binary format.

---

## Question 47: How do you deserialize a structure?
**Answer:**  
You read the structure's data from a file in binary format.

    float real;
    float imag;
};
