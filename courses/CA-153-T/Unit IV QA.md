### 2. LED Interfacing
4. **How do you interface an LED with a microcontroller?**  
   An LED is connected to a microcontroller pin through a current-limiting resistor. The pin is toggled to turn the LED ON or OFF.

5. **Write a program to blink an LED connected to Port 1, Pin 0.**
   ```c
   #include <reg51.h>

   sbit LED = P1^0;  // Define LED connected to Port 1, Pin 0

   void delay() {
       int i, j;
       for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
           for (j = 0; j < 100; j++);
       }
   }

   void main() {
       while (1) {
           LED = 1;  // Turn ON LED
           delay();
           LED = 0;  // Turn OFF LED
           delay();
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. Switch Interfacing
6. **How do you interface a switch with a microcontroller?**  
   A switch is connected to a microcontroller pin. When pressed, it changes the pin's logic level, which can be read by the microcontroller.

7. **Write a program to read a switch input and control an LED.**
   ```c
   #include <reg51.h>

   sbit SWITCH = P1^1;  // Define switch connected to Port 1, Pin 1
   sbit LED = P1^0;     // Define LED connected to Port 1, Pin 0

   void main() {
       while (1) {
           if (SWITCH == 0) {  // If switch is pressed
               LED = 1;        // Turn ON LED
           } else {
               LED = 0;        // Turn OFF LED
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 4. 7-Segment Display Interfacing
8. **What is a 7-segment display?**  
   A 7-segment display is an electronic display device used to display decimal numbers and some alphabets.

9. **How do you interface a 7-segment display with a microcontroller?**  
   The 7-segment display is connected to microcontroller pins, and specific segments are activated to display numbers.

10. **Write a program to display the digit '5' on a 7-segment display.**
    ```c
    #include <reg51.h>

    void main() {
        P1 = 0x6D;  // Hex code for displaying '5' on a common cathode 7-segment display
        while (1);
    }
    ```

### 5. LCD Interfacing
11. **What is an LCD?**  
    An LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a flat-panel display used to display alphanumeric characters and symbols.

12. **How do you interface an LCD with a microcontroller?**  
    An LCD is connected to microcontroller pins for data and control signals. Commands and data are sent to the LCD to display information.

13. **Write a program to display "HELLO" on an LCD.**
    ```c
    #include <reg51.h>

    sbit RS = P2^0;  // Register Select
    sbit EN = P2^1;  // Enable
    sbit RW = P2^2;  // Read/Write

    void delay() {
        int i, j;
        for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < 100; j++);
        }
    }

    void lcd_command(unsigned char cmd) {
        P1 = cmd;
        RS = 0; RW = 0; EN = 1;
        delay();
        EN = 0;
    }

    void lcd_data(unsigned char data) {
        P1 = data;
        RS = 1; RW = 0; EN = 1;
        delay();
        EN = 0;
    }

    void main() {
        lcd_command(0x38);  // Initialize LCD
        lcd_command(0x0C);  // Display ON, Cursor OFF
        lcd_command(0x01);  // Clear display
        lcd_command(0x80);  // Move to first line

        lcd_data('H');
        lcd_data('E');
        lcd_data('L');
        lcd_data('L');
        lcd_data('O');

            MOTOR = 1;  // Turn ON motor
            // Add delay or condition as needed
            MOTOR = 0;  // Turn OFF motor
            // Add delay or condition as needed
        }
    }
    ```

### 7. Sensor Interfacing
16. **How do you interface a temperature sensor with a microcontroller?**  
    A temperature sensor (e.g., LM35) outputs an analog voltage proportional to the temperature. An ADC is used to convert the analog signal to digital.

    ```c
    #include <reg51.h>

    void main() {
        unsigned char temp;
        // Assume ADC initialization and reading logic here
        temp = 0x1E;  // Example temperature value
        P1 = temp;    // Display temperature on Port 1
        while (1);
    }
    ```

### 8. UART Communication
18. **What is UART?**  
    UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a serial communication protocol used for data exchange between devices.

19. **Write a program to transmit a character using UART.**
    ```c
    #include <reg51.h>

    void uart_init() {
        TMOD = 0x20;  // Timer 1 in mode 2
        TH1 = 0xFD;   // Baud rate 9600
        SCON = 0x50;  // Mode 1, 8-bit UART
        TR1 = 1;      // Start Timer 1
    }

    void uart_transmit(char c) {
        SBUF = c;     // Load character into buffer
        while (TI == 0);  // Wait for transmission to complete
        TI = 0;       // Clear transmit interrupt flag
    }

    void main() {
        uart_init();
        uart_transmit('A');  // Transmit character 'A'
        while (1);
