## 1. Features of 8051 Microcontroller

- 8-bit microcontroller.
- 4 KB on-chip ROM.
- 128 bytes on-chip RAM.
- 32 I/O pins organized into 4 ports (P0â€“P3).
- Two 16-bit timers/counters.
- Full-duplex UART for serial communication.
- 5 interrupt sources.

---

## 2. Block Diagram and Architecture of 8051

The 8051 architecture includes:
- **CPU**: Executes instructions.
- **RAM**: Temporary data storage.
- **ROM**: Stores program code.
- **I/O Ports**: For interfacing external devices.
- **Timers/Counters**: For time-based operations.
- **Serial Port**: For communication.
- **Interrupt Controller**: Handles interrupts.

## 3. Internal Memory Organization

- **128 Bytes of RAM**:
  - 32 bytes for register banks.
  - 16 bytes for bit-addressable memory.
  - 80 bytes for general-purpose memory.

---

## 4. Special Function Registers (SFRs)

SFRs are used to control the operation of the microcontroller. Examples:
- **ACC**: Accumulator.
- **B**: Auxiliary register.
- **PSW**: Program Status Word.
- **SP**: Stack Pointer.

---

## 5. PSW Register

The PSW register contains flags for arithmetic operations:
- **CY**: Carry flag.
- **AC**: Auxiliary carry flag.
- **OV**: Overflow flag.
- **P**: Parity flag.

---

## 6. Pin Functions of 8051

- **Port 0 (P0)**: Dual-purpose (I/O or address/data bus).
- **Port 1 (P1)**: General-purpose I/O.
- **Port 2 (P2)**: Dual-purpose (I/O or higher address bus).
- **Port 3 (P3)**: Special-purpose I/O (e.g., serial communication).

---

## 7. Structure of I/O Ports and Their Operation

Each port has:
- **Latch**: Stores the output value.
- **Driver**: Drives the output.
- **Input Buffer**: Reads the input value.

---

## 8. External Memory Interface

The 8051 can interface with external memory using:
- **ALE (Address Latch Enable)**: Latches the lower address byte.
- **PSEN (Program Store Enable)**: Reads external program memory.
- **RD/WR**: Reads/writes external data memory.

### Example: Toggle LEDs on Port 1

```c
#include <reg51.h>

void delay() {
    int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < 100; j++);
    }
}

void main() {
    while (1) {
        P1 = 0xFF;  // Turn ON all LEDs
        delay();
        P1 = 0x00;  // Turn OFF all LEDs
        delay();
    }
}
```

This program toggles all LEDs connected to Port 1 of the 8051 microcontroller.
