# Unit I: Introduction - Questions and Answers

### 1. Introduction to Microcontroller and Microprocessor
1. **What is a microcontroller?**  
   A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. It includes a processor, memory, and I/O peripherals on a single chip.

2. **What is a microprocessor?**  
   A microprocessor is a central processing unit (CPU) on a single chip, used in general-purpose computing systems. It requires external memory and peripherals for operation.

3. **What are the main differences between a microcontroller and a microprocessor?**  
   - Microcontroller: Integrated CPU, memory, and I/O ports; used in embedded systems.  
   - Microprocessor: Only CPU; requires external memory and peripherals; used in general-purpose systems.

4. **Why are microcontrollers preferred in embedded systems?**  
   Microcontrollers are compact, cost-effective, and consume less power, making them ideal for embedded systems.

5. **Write a program to toggle an LED using a microcontroller.**
   ```c
   #include <reg51.h>

   sbit LED = P1^0;  // Define LED connected to Port 1, Pin 0

   void delay() {
       int i, j;
       for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
           for (j = 0; j < 100; j++);
       }
   }

   void main() {
       while (1) {
           LED = 1;  // Turn ON LED
           delay();
           LED = 0;  // Turn OFF LED
           delay();
       }
   }
   ```

### 2. Difference between Microcontroller and Microprocessor
6. **What are the applications of microcontrollers?**  
   - Consumer electronics (e.g., washing machines, microwaves).  
   - Automotive systems (e.g., engine control units).  
   - Industrial automation (e.g., robotics).  
   - Medical devices (e.g., pacemakers).  
   - IoT devices (e.g., smart home systems).

7. **Why do microprocessors require external memory?**  
   Microprocessors are designed for general-purpose systems and do not include built-in memory, requiring external memory for program and data storage.

8. **Explain the cost difference between microcontrollers and microprocessors.**  
   Microcontrollers are cost-effective due to their integrated design, while microprocessors are more expensive because they require additional components like memory and peripherals.

9. **How does power consumption differ between microcontrollers and microprocessors?**  
   Microcontrollers consume less power, making them suitable for battery-operated devices, whereas microprocessors consume more power due to their higher processing capabilities.

10. **Write a program to read a switch input and control an LED.**
    ```c
    #include <reg51.h>

    sbit SWITCH = P1^1;  // Define switch connected to Port 1, Pin 1
    sbit LED = P1^0;     // Define LED connected to Port 1, Pin 0

    void main() {
        while (1) {
            if (SWITCH == 0) {  // If switch is pressed
                LED = 1;        // Turn ON LED
            } else {
                LED = 0;        // Turn OFF LED
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### 3. Classification of Microcontrollers
11. **What is Harvard architecture?**  
    Harvard architecture uses separate memory for instructions and data, allowing simultaneous access to both.

12. **What is Von Neumann architecture?**  
    Von Neumann architecture uses a single memory for both instructions and data, accessed sequentially.

13. **What are the advantages of 32-bit microcontrollers?**  
    - Higher processing power.  
    - Larger addressable memory.  
    - Suitable for complex applications like IoT and AI.

14. **Give examples of 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers.**  
    - 8-bit: 8051.  
    - 16-bit: MSP430.  
    - 32-bit: ARM Cortex-M.

15. **Write a program to blink two LEDs alternately.**
    ```c
    #include <reg51.h>

    sbit LED1 = P1^0;  // Define LED1 connected to Port 1, Pin 0
    sbit LED2 = P1^1;  // Define LED2 connected to Port 1, Pin 1

    void delay() {
        int i, j;
        for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < 100; j++);
        }
    }

    void main() {
        while (1) {
            LED1 = 1;  // Turn ON LED1
            LED2 = 0;  // Turn OFF LED2
            delay();
            LED1 = 0;  // Turn OFF LED1
            LED2 = 1;  // Turn ON LED2
            delay();
        }
    }
    ```
