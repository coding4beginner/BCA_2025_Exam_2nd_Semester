# Learning C Programming - Part 9: Pointers

## Introduction to Pointers
Pointers are variables that store memory addresses of other variables. They are one of the most powerful features of C that allows efficient memory management and direct memory manipulation. Pointers enable dynamic memory allocation, passing arguments by reference, and efficient handling of data structures.

## Pointer Declaration and Initialization
Pointers are declared using the asterisk (*) symbol:

```c
data_type *pointer_name;
```

To initialize a pointer, assign the address of a variable using the address-of operator (&):

```c
int num = 10;
int *ptr = &num;  // ptr now points to num
```

## Accessing Values through Pointers
The value stored at the address in a pointer is accessed using the dereference operator (*):

```c
int num = 10;
int *ptr = &num;
printf("Value: %d\n", *ptr);  // Prints 10
*ptr = 20;  // Changes the value of num to 20
```

## Pointer Arithmetic
C allows arithmetic operations on pointers, but the operations work differently than on regular variables:

```c
int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int *ptr = arr;  // Points to first element

printf("%d\n", *ptr);      // 10
printf("%d\n", *(ptr+1));  // 20
printf("%d\n", *(ptr+2));  // 30
```

## NULL Pointers
A NULL pointer is a pointer that doesn't point to any memory location:

```c
int *ptr = NULL;  // ptr is a NULL pointer
```

Always check if a pointer is NULL before dereferencing it to avoid segmentation faults.

## Programming Examples

### Example 1: Basic Pointer Operations
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 50;
    int *ptr;
    
    ptr = &num;  // Store address of num in ptr
    
    printf("Value of num: %d\n", num);
    printf("Address of num: %p\n", &num);
    printf("Value of ptr (address stored): %p\n", ptr);
    printf("Value pointed to by ptr: %d\n", *ptr);
    
    // Modifying value through pointer
    *ptr = 100;
    printf("New value of num: %d\n", num);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Pointers and Arrays
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *ptr = arr;  // arr is the address of the first element
    
    printf("Using array notation:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("arr[%d] = %d\n", i, arr[i]);
    }
    
    printf("\nUsing pointer notation:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("*(ptr + %d) = %d\n", i, *(ptr + i));
    }
    
    printf("\nUsing pointer increment:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("*ptr = %d\n", *ptr);
        ptr++;  // Move to next integer location
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 3: Pointers as Function Parameters
```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to swap two integers using pointers
void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}

int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 20;
    
    printf("Before swap: x = %d, y = %d\n", x, y);
    
    swap(&x, &y);  // Pass addresses of x and y
    
    printf("After swap: x = %d, y = %d\n", x, y);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 4: Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>  // Required for malloc() and free()

int main() {
    int *ptr;
    int n = 5;
    
    // Allocate memory for n integers
    ptr = (int*) malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Store values in allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ptr[i] = i * 10;
    }
    
    // Print values
    printf("Dynamically allocated array values:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", ptr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    
    // Free allocated memory when done
    free(ptr);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 5: Pointers to Pointers
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    int *ptr = &num;      // Pointer to num
    int **ptr_to_ptr = &ptr;  // Pointer to pointer
    
    printf("Value of num: %d\n", num);
    printf("Value using ptr: %d\n", *ptr);
    printf("Value using ptr_to_ptr: %d\n", **ptr_to_ptr);
    
    // Modify value using pointer to pointer
    **ptr_to_ptr = 20;
    
    printf("New value of num: %d\n", num);
    
    return 0;
}
```
