# Part 14: Advanced File Operations

## Chapter 1: Binary File Operations

### 1.1 Introduction to Binary Files

Binary files store data in the same format as it's held in memory, making them efficient for storing complex data structures and large amounts of information. Unlike text files, binary files don't convert data to human-readable text format, which makes them faster to process and more space-efficient. In this subchapter, we'll learn how to work with binary files in C, a crucial skill for any programmer dealing with data persistence, configuration storage, or any application requiring efficient data storage.

Understanding binary file operations allows you to create more sophisticated applications that can store and retrieve complex data structures without the overhead of text conversion. Binary files are commonly used in applications requiring high performance, like databases, media players, and games, where efficiency in reading and writing data is critical.

Binary files are read and written using specialized functions in C that don't perform any character translations. This means data is stored exactly as it appears in memory, making binary files ideal for storing numerical data, custom data structures, and other non-text information. The functions we'll explore allow precise control over how data is stored and retrieved.

When working with binary files, you need to understand not just file operations but also concepts like endianness (byte ordering), structure padding, and data alignment. These factors affect how data is stored across different systems and can impact the portability of your binary files. Throughout this subchapter, we'll address these considerations to ensure your binary file operations work correctly across different environments.

Binary files require careful handling, as even small errors can corrupt the entire file. We'll learn proper techniques for error checking, file validation, and recovery strategies to ensure your applications can handle unexpected situations gracefully.

#### Example 1: Opening and writing to a binary file
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    
    // Open file in binary write mode
    file = fopen("numbers.bin", "wb");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Write array to binary file
    fwrite(numbers, sizeof(int), 5, file);
    
    fclose(file);
    printf("Data written successfully.\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 2: Reading from a binary file
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    int numbers[5];
    
    // Open file in binary read mode
    file = fopen("numbers.bin", "rb");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Read array from binary file
    fread(numbers, sizeof(int), 5, file);
    
    fclose(file);
    
    // Display the numbers
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", numbers[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 3: Writing a structure to a binary file
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct {
    int id;
    char name[50];
    float salary;
} Employee;

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    Employee emp;
    
    // Initialize struct
    emp.id = 101;
    strcpy(emp.name, "John Doe");
    emp.salary = 45000.50;
    
    // Open file in binary write mode
    file = fopen("employee.bin", "wb");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Write struct to file
    fwrite(&emp, sizeof(Employee), 1, file);
    
    fclose(file);
    printf("Employee data written successfully.\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 4: Reading a structure from a binary file
```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int id;
    char name[50];
    float salary;
} Employee;

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    Employee emp;
    
    // Open file in binary read mode
    file = fopen("employee.bin", "rb");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Read struct from file
    fread(&emp, sizeof(Employee), 1, file);
    
    fclose(file);
    
    // Display the employee information
    printf("ID: %d\n", emp.id);
    printf("Name: %s\n", emp.name);
    printf("Salary: %.2f\n", emp.salary);
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 5: Appending to a binary file
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct {
    int id;
    char name[50];
    float salary;
} Employee;

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    Employee emp;
    
    // Initialize struct
    emp.id = 102;
    strcpy(emp.name, "Jane Smith");
    emp.salary = 52000.75;
    
    // Open file in binary append mode
    file = fopen("employee.bin", "ab");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Append struct to file
    fwrite(&emp, sizeof(Employee), 1, file);
    
    fclose(file);
    printf("Employee data appended successfully.\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Exercise 1
Write a program that creates a binary file containing 10 integer values generated using a loop. Then read the file and calculate the sum and average of the values.

#### Exercise 2
Create a student record system that stores student information (roll number, name, marks in 3 subjects) in a binary file. Implement functions to add a new student, display all students, and search for a student by roll number.

#### Exercise 3
Write a program that copies the contents of one binary file to another. Test it with different types of files and verify that the content is identical.

#### Exercise 4
Implement a program that reads a binary file containing integer values and sorts them in ascending order. Write the sorted values back to a new binary file.

#### Exercise 5
Create a program that merges two binary files containing sorted integers into a third file, maintaining the sorted order.

### 1.2 Random Access in Binary Files

Random access to files allows programs to read from or write to any position within a file without having to process all preceding data. This capability is particularly powerful in binary files, where data structures have fixed sizes and can be precisely located. In this subchapter, we'll explore how to navigate within binary files, jumping directly to specific locations to manipulate data efficiently.

Random access is essential when working with large files or databases where sequential access would be too time-consuming. For example, when updating a specific record in a database file, random access allows your program to jump directly to that record rather than reading through all preceding records, dramatically improving performance for applications that need to access scattered portions of a file.

The key to random access in binary files is understanding file position indicators and the functions that manipulate them. In C, we use functions like `fseek()`, `ftell()`, and `rewind()` to control the current position within a file. These functions allow us to move the file pointer to any byte position, enabling precise control over where reading and writing operations occur.

When implementing random access, it's crucial to understand the structure of your data and how it maps to byte positions in the file. For structured data, this often means calculating offsets based on the size of your data structures and the index of the record you want to access. This approach allows for efficient lookup and modification of specific records without processing the entire file.

Random access operations require careful error handling and boundary checking. It's easy to seek past the end of a file or try to read from invalid positions. Throughout this subchapter, we'll cover techniques for validating seek operations and ensuring that your file access operations are robust and reliable.

#### Example 1: Using fseek() for random access
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int readValue;
    
    // Create a binary file with 5 integers
    file = fopen("random.bin", "wb+");
    fwrite(numbers, sizeof(int), 5, file);
    
    // Seek to the third integer (position 2, zero-based)
    fseek(file, 2 * sizeof(int), SEEK_SET);
    
    // Read value at that position
    fread(&readValue, sizeof(int), 1, file);
    printf("Value at position 2: %d\n", readValue);
    
    // Seek to the last integer
    fseek(file, -1 * sizeof(int), SEEK_END);
    
    // Read value at that position
    fread(&readValue, sizeof(int), 1, file);
    printf("Last value: %d\n", readValue);
    
    fclose(file);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 2: Random updating of records
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct {
    int id;
    char name[50];
    float salary;
} Employee;

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    Employee employees[3] = {
        {101, "John Doe", 45000.50},
        {102, "Jane Smith", 52000.75},
        {103, "Bob Johnson", 48500.25}
    };
    Employee temp;
    
    // Create a binary file with employee records
    file = fopen("employees.bin", "wb+");
    fwrite(employees, sizeof(Employee), 3, file);
    
    // Update the second employee's salary
    fseek(file, sizeof(Employee), SEEK_SET);  // Position to second record
    fread(&temp, sizeof(Employee), 1, file);
    
    temp.salary = 55000.00;  // Update salary
    
    fseek(file, sizeof(Employee), SEEK_SET);  // Go back to second record
    fwrite(&temp, sizeof(Employee), 1, file);
    
    // Read all records to verify update
    rewind(file);  // Go back to beginning of file
    
    printf("Employee Records:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        fread(&temp, sizeof(Employee), 1, file);
        printf("ID: %d, Name: %s, Salary: %.2f\n", 
               temp.id, temp.name, temp.salary);
    }
    
    fclose(file);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 3: Using ftell() to get current position
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    long position;
    
    // Create a binary file with 5 integers
    file = fopen("position.bin", "wb+");
    fwrite(numbers, sizeof(int), 5, file);
    
    // Get current position after writing
    position = ftell(file);
    printf("After writing, position is: %ld bytes\n", position);
    
    // Seek to the middle and get position
    fseek(file, 2 * sizeof(int), SEEK_SET);
    position = ftell(file);
    printf("After seeking to middle, position is: %ld bytes\n", position);
    
    fclose(file);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 4: Random access with multiple record types
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct {
    char type;  // 'I' for integer, 'F' for float, 'S' for string
    union {
        int i_value;
        float f_value;
        char s_value[20];
    } data;
} Record;

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    Record records[3];
    Record temp;
    
    // Initialize records
    records[0].type = 'I';
    records[0].data.i_value = 42;
    
    records[1].type = 'F';
    records[1].data.f_value = 3.14;
    
    records[2].type = 'S';
    strcpy(records[2].data.s_value, "Hello");
    
    // Write records
    file = fopen("mixed.bin", "wb+");
    fwrite(records, sizeof(Record), 3, file);
    
    // Random access to second record
    fseek(file, sizeof(Record), SEEK_SET);
    fread(&temp, sizeof(Record), 1, file);
    
    // Display based on type
    if (temp.type == 'F') {
        printf("Found float value: %f\n", temp.data.f_value);
    }
    
    fclose(file);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example 5: Creating an index for fast access
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct {
    int id;
    char name[50];
    float salary;
} Employee;

typedef struct {
    int id;
    long position;  // File position where record can be found
} Index;

int compare_indices(const void *a, const void *b) {
    return ((Index*)a)->id - ((Index*)b)->id;
}

int main() {
    FILE *data_file, *index_file;
    Employee employees[5] = {
        {105, "Emma Wilson", 62000.00},
        {103, "Bob Johnson", 48500.25},
        {101, "John Doe", 45000.50},
        {104, "Mike Brown", 51200.75},
        {102, "Jane Smith", 52000.75}
    };
    Index indices[5];
    
    // Create data file
    data_file = fopen("emp_data.bin", "wb+");
    
    // Write records and build index
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        indices[i].id = employees[i].id;
        indices[i].position = ftell(data_file);
        fwrite(&employees[i], sizeof(Employee), 1, data_file);
    }
    
    // Sort index by ID
    qsort(indices, 5, sizeof(Index), compare_indices);
    
    // Write index to separate file
    index_file = fopen("emp_index.bin", "wb");
    fwrite(indices, sizeof(Index), 5, index_file);
    fclose(index_file);
    
    // Use index to find employee with ID 103
    index_file = fopen("emp_index.bin", "rb");
    fread(indices, sizeof(Index), 5, index_file);
    fclose(index_file);
    
    // Binary search in the index
    int target_id = 103;
    int found = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        if (indices[i].id == target_id) {
            // Use the position to get the record
            fseek(data_file, indices[i].position, SEEK_SET);
            Employee emp;
            fread(&emp, sizeof(Employee), 1, data_file);
            printf("Found Employee - ID: %d, Name: %s, Salary: %.2f\n", 
                   emp.id, emp.name, emp.salary);
            found = 1;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    if (!found) {
        printf("Employee with ID %d not found.\n", target_id);
    }
    
    fclose(data_file);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Exercise 1
Write a program that creates a binary file with 100 random integers. Implement functions to read any specific integer by its position (0-99) without reading the entire file.

#### Exercise 2
Create a
