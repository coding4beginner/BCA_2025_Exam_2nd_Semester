# Part 1: Introduction to C Programming

## Introduction
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. Originally designed for implementing the UNIX operating system, C has become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time. Its influence can be seen in many modern languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python.

## Why Learn C?
- **Efficiency**: C programs are efficient and fast
- **Portability**: C programs can run on different platforms with minimal changes
- **Foundation**: Learning C builds a strong programming foundation
- **Still Relevant**: Many systems, embedded devices, and operating systems are written in C

## Structure of a C Program

A basic C program has the following structure:

```c
// This is a comment
/* This is a 
   multi-line comment */

// Including header files
#include <stdio.h>

// The main function - program execution starts here
int main() {
    // Statements and expressions
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    
    // Return statement
    return 0;
}
```

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To write and run C programs, you need:
1. A text editor (like Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
2. A C compiler (like GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio)

### Windows Setup:
- Install MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) or Visual Studio Community
- Add the compiler to your system PATH

### Mac Setup:
- Install Xcode Command Line Tools (includes the Clang compiler)
- Open Terminal and run: `xcode-select --install`

### Linux Setup:
- GCC is usually pre-installed or can be installed via package manager
- For Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install build-essential`

## Your First C Program

Create a file named `hello.c` with the following content:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Compiling and Running:
- Open a terminal/command prompt
- Navigate to the directory containing your file
- Compile: `gcc hello.c -o hello`
- Run: `./hello` (on Linux/Mac) or `hello.exe` (on Windows)

## Basic Syntax Rules

1. **Case Sensitivity**: C is case-sensitive (`main` is different from `Main`)
2. **Statements**: Each statement ends with a semicolon (`;`)
3. **Whitespace**: Spaces, tabs, and newlines are ignored by the compiler
4. **Blocks**: Related code is grouped in blocks using curly braces `{}`
5. **Comments**: Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments

## Code Samples

### 1. Simple Output
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Learning C programming is fun!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Multiple Print Statements
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Line 1\n");
    printf("Line 2\n");
    printf("Line 3\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Basic Arithmetic
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("5 + 3 = %d\n", 5 + 3);
    printf("5 - 3 = %d\n", 5 - 3);
    printf("5 * 3 = %d\n", 5 * 3);
    printf("5 / 3 = %d\n", 5 / 3);
    return 0;
}
```

### 4. Escape Sequences
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Newline: Hello\nWorld\n");
    printf("Tab: Hello\tWorld\n");
    printf("Backslash: Hello\\World\n");
    printf("Double Quote: \"Hello World\"\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### 5. Printing Different Data Types
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Integer: %d\n", 42);
    printf("Float: %f\n", 3.14);
    printf("Character: %c\n", 'A');
    printf("String: %s\n", "Hello");
    printf("Multiple values: %d and %f\n", 10, 5.5);
    return 0;
}
```

## Exercises

1. Write a program that prints your name and age on separate lines.
2. Modify the "Hello World" program to print a welcome message with your name.
3. Write a program that prints the result of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing 10 and 5.
4. Create a program that prints a simple ASCII art shape (like a triangle or square) using asterisks.
5. Write a program that prints "C Programming" with a box around it using ASCII characters (e.g., +, -, |).

## Self-Assessment Questions

1. **What is the correct file extension for C program files?**
   - Answer: `.c`

2. **Which function is typically used for standard output in C?**
   - Answer: `printf()`

3. **What is the purpose of the `return 0;` statement in the main function?**
   - Answer: It indicates successful program execution to the operating system.
