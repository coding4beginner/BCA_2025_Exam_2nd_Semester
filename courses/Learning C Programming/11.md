# Learning C Programming - Part 11: File I/O

## Introduction to File I/O
File input/output (I/O) operations in C allow programs to store data permanently and retrieve it later. Unlike variables that lose their values when a program terminates, files provide persistent storage. C provides standard library functions to create, read, write, and manipulate files.

## File Operations in C
The standard library `<stdio.h>` provides functions to perform file operations:

1. **Opening a file**: `fopen()`
2. **Reading from a file**: `fscanf()`, `fgetc()`, `fgets()`
3. **Writing to a file**: `fprintf()`, `fputc()`, `fputs()`
4. **Closing a file**: `fclose()`
5. **Positioning within a file**: `fseek()`, `ftell()`, `rewind()`

## File Pointers
A file is accessed through a file pointer of type `FILE*`:

```c
FILE *filePointer;
```

## Opening and Closing Files

### Opening a File
```c
FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode);
```

Common file opening modes:
- `"r"` - Open for reading (file must exist)
- `"w"` - Open for writing (creates new file or truncates existing file)
- `"a"` - Open for appending (creates new file if it doesn't exist)
- `"r+"` - Open for reading and writing (file must exist)
- `"w+"` - Open for reading and writing (creates new file or truncates existing file)
- `"a+"` - Open for reading and appending (creates new file if it doesn't exist)

### Closing a File
```c
int fclose(FILE *filePointer);
```

Always close files when you're done with them to avoid resource leaks.

## Programming Examples

### Example 1: Writing Text to a File
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    char filename[] = "sample.txt";
    
    // Open file for writing
    file = fopen(filename, "w");
    
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file %s\n", filename);
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Write to file
    fprintf(file, "Hello, World!\n");
    fprintf(file, "This is a sample text file.\n");
    fprintf(file, "Created with C programming.\n");
    
    // Close the file
    fclose(file);
    
    printf("File %s created successfully!\n", filename);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Reading Text from a File
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    char filename[] = "sample.txt";
    char buffer[100];
    
    // Open file for reading
    file = fopen(filename, "r");
    
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file %s\n", filename);
        return 1;
    }
    
    printf("Contents of %s:\n", filename);
    printf("-------------------------------\n");
    
    // Read and print file line by line
    while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), file) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", buffer);
    }
    
    printf("-------------------------------\n");
    
    // Close the file
    fclose(file);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 3: Character-by-Character File I/O
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *sourceFile, *targetFile;
    char sourceFilename[] = "source.txt";
    char targetFilename[] = "target.txt";
    int ch;
    
    // Open source file for reading
    sourceFile = fopen(sourceFilename, "r");
    if (sourceFile == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening source file %s\n", sourceFilename);
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Open target file for writing
    targetFile = fopen(targetFilename, "w");
    if (targetFile == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening target file %s\n", targetFilename);
        fclose(sourceFile);
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Copy source to target, character by character
    while ((ch = fgetc(sourceFile)) != EOF) {
        fputc(ch, targetFile);
    }
    
    printf("File copied successfully from %s to %s\n", 
           sourceFilename, targetFilename);
    
    // Close files
    fclose(sourceFile);
    fclose(targetFile);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 4: Reading and Writing Formatted Data
```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int id;
    float gpa;
};

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    struct Student students[3] = {
        {"Alice", 101, 3.8},
        {"Bob", 102, 3.5},
        {"Charlie", 103, 3.9}
    };
    
    // Write student data to file
    file = fopen("students.txt", "w");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file for writing\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        fprintf(file, "%s %d %.1f\n", 
                students[i].name, 
                students[i].id, 
                students[i].gpa);
    }
    
    fclose(file);
    
    // Clear the student array
    struct Student readStudents[3];
    
    // Read student data from file
    file = fopen("students.txt", "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file for reading\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    printf("Student Records:\n");
    printf("ID\tName\tGPA\n");
    printf("-------------------------\n");
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        fscanf(file, "%s %d %f", 
               readStudents[i].name, 
               &readStudents[i].id, 
               &readStudents[i].gpa);
        
        printf("%d\t%s\t%.1f\n", 
               readStudents[i].id, 
               readStudents[i].name, 
               readStudents[i].gpa);
    }
    
    fclose(file);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 5: File Positioning
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file;
    char filename[] = "numbers.txt";
    int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int readNum;
    
    // Create a file with numbers
    file = fopen(filename, "w");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file for writing\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        fprintf(file, "%d\n", numbers[i]);
    }
    
    fclose(file);
    
    // Open file for reading and positioning
    file = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file for reading\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Read the 3rd number (index 2)
    fseek(file, 0, SEEK_SET);  // Go to beginning
    
    // Skip first two numbers
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        fscanf(file, "%d", &readNum);
    }
    
    // Read the 3rd number
    fscanf(file, "%d", &readNum);
    printf("Third number: %d\n", readNum);
    
    // Get current position
    long position = ftell(file);
    printf("Current position: %ld bytes\n", position);
    
    // Go back to beginning
    rewind(file);
    
    // Read first number
    fscanf(file, "%d", &readNum);
    printf("First number: %d\n", readNum);
    
    fclose(file);
    
    return 0;
}
```
