**Teaching Scheme:**  
Practical: 04 Hrs/Week  
Credits: 02  

**Examination Scheme:**  
Continuous Evaluation: 15 Marks  
End-Semester: 35 Marks  

**Course Objectives:**  
- To learn advanced features in C Programming  
- To study advanced data types  
- To understand built-in library functions  

**Course Outcomes:**  
On completion of the course, student will be able to:  
- Write programs using pointers and structures  
- Use Pre-processor directives  
- Manipulate strings using library functions  
- Write programs to perform operations on Files  

**Guidelines for Instructor's Manual:**  
The instructor shall frame at least 12 assignments. Instructor’s manual consisting of University syllabus, conduction & Assessment guidelines is to be developed.  

**Guidelines for Student Journal:**  
The laboratory assignments are to be submitted by student in the form of journal. Journal consists of Certificate, table of contents, and handwritten write-up for each assignment. Write-up shall include Title, Problem Statement, software and Hardware requirements, Date of Completion. Program codes with sample output of all performed assignments are to be submitted as softcopy. Use of DVD containing students programs maintained by lab In-charge is highly encouraged. For reference one or two journals may be maintained with program prints.  

**Guidelines for Assessment:**  
Continuous assessment of laboratory work is to be carried out based on overall performance of students. For each lab assignment, the instructor will assign grade/marks based on parameters such as timely completion, understanding, neatness etc. with appropriate weightage.
