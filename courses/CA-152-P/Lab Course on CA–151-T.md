## CA – 152 – P: Lab Course on CA – 151 - T 

### **Teaching Scheme**  
- **Practical:** 04 Hrs/Week  
- **Credits:** 02  

### **Examination Scheme**  
- **Continuous Evaluation:** 15 Marks  
- **End-Semester:** 35 Marks  

### **Course Objectives**  
- Learn advanced features in C Programming  
- Study advanced data types  
- Understand built-in library functions  

### **Course Outcomes**  
On completion of the course, students will be able to:  
- Write programs using pointers and structures  
- Use pre-processor directives  
- Manipulate strings using library functions  
- Write programs to perform operations on files  

### **Guidelines for Instructor's Manual**  
The instructor shall frame at least 12 assignments. An instructor’s manual consisting of the University syllabus, conduction, and assessment guidelines is to be developed.  

### **Guidelines for Student Journal**  
The laboratory assignments are to be submitted by students in the form of a journal. The journal consists of:  
- Certificate  
- Table of contents  
- Handwritten write-up for each assignment  

The write-up shall include:  
- Title  
- Problem Statement  
- Software and Hardware requirements  
- Date of Completion  

Program codes with sample output of all performed assignments are to be submitted as a soft copy. The use of a DVD containing students' programs maintained by the lab in-charge is highly encouraged. For reference, one or two journals may be maintained with program prints.  

### **Guidelines for Assessment**  
Continuous assessment of laboratory work is to be carried out based on the overall performance of students. For each lab assignment, the instructor will assign grades/marks based on parameters such as:  
- Timely completion  
- Understanding  
- Neatness  

Appropriate weightage should be given to each parameter.
