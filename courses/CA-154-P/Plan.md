## **Chapter 1: Microcontroller Basics**

### **1.1 What is a Microcontroller?**

- A **microcontroller** is a small, self-contained computing system on a single integrated circuit. It includes:
  - A **processor (CPU)**
  - **Memory** (Flash/ROM for program storage and RAM for data)
  - **I/O ports** (digital/analog)
  - Other peripherals (timers, ADC, etc.)

### **1.2 Microcontrollers vs. Microprocessors**

- **Microcontroller**:
  - On-chip memory and peripherals.
  - Optimized for control-oriented tasks (e.g., sensor reading, device controlling).
- **Microprocessor**:
  - Requires external chips for memory and I/O.
  - Typically found in systems needing more processing power (desktops, laptops).

### **1.3 Common Applications**

- Home appliances (e.g., washing machines, microwave ovens)
- Robotics (e.g., controlling motors and sensors)
- Automobile electronics (e.g., engine control units)
- Smart devices (IoT sensors and controllers)

### **1.4 Real-World Relevance for BCA Students**

- Understanding fundamental **embedded systems** concepts (polling, interrupts, interfacing).
- Familiarity with real-time constraints, cost-effective designs.
- Gateway to emerging fields like IoT, robotics, and automation.

#### **End-of-Chapter Question (Chapter 1)**

### 1. **Explain two key differences between microcontrollers and microprocessors. Give a real-world example where a microcontroller is preferable.**

## **Chapter 2: 8051 Architecture & Key Features**

### **2.1 Overview of the 8051 Family**

- Originally developed by Intel; remains popular for teaching and simple embedded applications.
- 8-bit CPU with on-chip ROM and RAM.

### **2.2 Internal Architecture**

- **CPU**: 8-bit, meaning it processes 8 bits at a time.
- **Internal RAM**: 128 or 256 bytes for data storage.
- **Internal ROM**: Often 4 KB (can be external/expandable).
- **Special Function Registers (SFRs)**: Control timers, I/O ports, serial interface, etc.

### **2.3 Pin Diagram & Ports**

- Typically a 40-pin DIP package.
  - **Port 0 (pins 32–39)**: Multiplexed data/address lines (can be used as general I/O).
  - **Port 1 (pins 1–8)**: Pure I/O.
  - **Port 2 (pins 21–28)**: Higher address lines (external memory mode) / I/O.
  - **Port 3 (pins 10–17)**: Special I/O (UART, external interrupts).
- **Oscillator pins**: XTAL1, XTAL2 for clock input.
- **Reset pin (RST)**: Active high reset input.

### **2.4 Memory Organization**

- **Program Memory (Code Space)**:
  - Internal ROM or external memory mapped at addresses 0000H onward.
- **Data Memory (Internal RAM)**:
  - Lower 128 bytes with 4 register banks and bit-addressable memory (20H–2FH).
  - Upper SFR space (80H–FFH) for controlling peripherals like timers, serial ports, etc.

### **2.5 Key Features Recap**

- On-chip serial port, timers, interrupts, and I/O ports make it suitable for many standalone applications.

#### **End-of-Chapter Question (Chapter 2)**

### 1. **How does the 8051 organize its internal RAM and what are the advantages of having bit-addressable sections?**

## **Chapter 3: 8051 Instruction Set & Assembly Language Basics**

### **3.1 Assembly vs. Embedded C**

- **Assembly**:
  - Direct, fine-grained control.
  - Typically yields optimized, smaller code.
- **Embedded C**:
  - Easier to write and maintain.
  - Faster to develop large projects.

### **3.2 8051 Instruction Groups**

### 1. **Data Transfer**: `MOV`, `MOVC`, `MOVX`, `XCH`, etc.

### 2. **Arithmetic**: `ADD`, `SUBB`, `MUL`, `DIV`, `INC`, `DEC`, etc.

### 3. **Logical**: `ANL`, `ORL`, `XRL`, `CLR`, `CPL`

### 4. **Branching**: `SJMP`, `LJMP`, `AJMP`, `CJNE`, `DJNZ`, `JZ`, `JNZ`

### 5. **Bit Manipulation**: `SETB`, `CLR bit`, `JB`, `JNB`, etc.

### **3.3 Addressing Modes**

- **Immediate**: `MOV A, #0x12`
- **Register**: `MOV A, R0`
- **Direct**: `MOV A, 30H`
- **Indirect**: `MOV A, @R0`
- **Relative**: used with conditional jumps (`SJMP`, `CJNE`)

### **3.4 Simple Assembly Example**

#### **Example 1: Adding Two Numbers**

```assembly
; Adds two 8-bit numbers and places result in RAM location 30H
        ORG 0000H
START:  MOV A, #0x0A    ; Load immediate value 0x0A into accumulator
        ADD A, #0x05    ; A = A + 0x05 => A = 0x0F
        MOV 30H, A      ; Store the sum into RAM[30H]
        SJMP $
        END
```

**Explanation:**

ORG 0000H indicates the start of the code memory.
The accumulator (A) is loaded with 0x0A and then 0x05 is added to it, storing the result in an internal RAM location.
SJMP $ is an infinite loop to halt execution.

### 3.5 Introduction to 8051 C Programming

Typically, you include a header file like REG51.H which maps SFR names.
Data types often match standard C, but memory-specific keywords (e.g., idata, xdata) may appear for some compilers.

### End-of-Chapter Question (Chapter 3)

List two advantages and two drawbacks of using 8051 assembly language instead of embedded C for a moderately complex application.

## Chapter 4: Timers, Counters, & Interrupts in 8051

### 4.1 Timers & Counters Overview

Timer/Counter Registers: Timer0 (TH0, TL0), Timer1 (TH1, TL1).
Modes defined by TMOD register:
Mode 0: 13-bit timer.
Mode 1: 16-bit timer.
Mode 2: 8-bit auto-reload.
Mode 3: Split Timer mode.
TCON register: controls timer start/stop bits (TR0, TR1) and overflow flags (TF0, TF1).

#### Example 2: Generating a Delay

```assembly
; Timer0 in Mode 1 (16-bit) to generate a delay

        ORG 0000H

START: MOV TMOD, #01H ; Timer0 in mode 1 (16-bit)
MOV TH0, #4CH
MOV TL0, #00H ; Load initial count for desired delay
SETB TR0 ; Start Timer0

WAIT: JNB TF0, WAIT ; Wait until Timer0 overflows (TF0=1)
CLR TR0 ; Stop the timer
CLR TF0 ; Clear overflow flag
; --- Perform next action here ---

        SJMP START       ; Repeat forever
        END
```

### 4.2 Interrupts

### 8051 supports 5 sources:

- Timer0 overflow
- Timer1 overflow
- External interrupt 0
- External interrupt 1
- Serial (UART) interrupt

Interrupt Enable (IE) register and Interrupt Priority (IP) register control the enabling and priority of these interrupts.

#### Example 3: External Interrupt in C

```c
#include <REG51.H>

sbit LED = P1^0; // LED on Port1.0

// Interrupt Service Routine for INT0
void ISR_External0(void) interrupt 0 {
LED = ~LED; // Toggle LED whenever INT0 occurs
}

void main() {
IE = 0x81; // Enable EA (global) and EX0
IT0 = 1; // Edge-triggered interrupt 0

    while(1) {
        // Main loop
    }

}
```

### End-of-Chapter Question (Chapter 4)

Differentiate between timer overflow interrupts and external interrupts. Give a scenario where each would be used in an application.

## Chapter 5: Interfacing Techniques

### 5.1 Overview of Interfacing

Interfacing is connecting external devices (sensors, actuators, displays) to the 8051.
Requires understanding of:
Pin configurations
Voltage/current constraints
Often uses driver ICs (e.g., ULN2003, L293D)

### 5.2 LED & Switch

LED: Connect with a current-limiting resistor.
Switch: Typically requires pull-up or pull-down resistor; the 8051’s internal pull-ups can also be used.

#### Example 4: LED & Switch (C)
```c
#include <REG51.H>

sbit LED = P2^0; // LED at P2.0
sbit SW = P1^0; // Switch at P1.0

void main() {
  LED = 0; // Turn OFF LED

  while(1) {
    if(SW == 0) // If switch pressed (assuming active LOW)
      LED = 1; // Turn ON LED
    else
      LED = 0; // Turn OFF LED
  }
}
```

### 5.3 DAC Interfacing (Waveform Generation)

Digital-to-Analog Converter (e.g., DAC0808) can generate analog voltages or waveforms.

### 5.4 LCD Interfacing (16x2)

Usually involves:

### 8 data lines (D0–D7) or 4 data lines in 4-bit mode.

Control lines: RS (Register Select), R/W (Read/Write), EN (Enable).

#### Example 5: Simple LCD Write

```c
#include <REG51.H>

sbit RS = P3^0;
sbit RW = P3^1;
sbit EN = P3^2;
#define LCD_PORT P2

void lcd_cmd(unsigned char cmd) {
LCD_PORT = cmd;
RS = 0; // Command mode
RW = 0; // Write
EN = 1;
// small delay
EN = 0;
}

void lcd_data(unsigned char dat) {
LCD_PORT = dat;
RS = 1; // Data mode
RW = 0; // Write
EN = 1;
// small delay
EN = 0;
}

void lcd_init() {
lcd_cmd(0x38); // 8-bit, 2 lines, 5x7 font
lcd_cmd(0x0E); // Display on, cursor on
lcd_cmd(0x01); // Clear display
}

void main() {
lcd_init();
lcd_data('H');
lcd_data('i');
while(1);
}
```

### 5.5 Stepper & DC Motor Interfacing

Stepper Motor: Driven in sequence (like 1001, 1100, 0110, 0011 for 4-step).
DC Motor: H-bridge driver (e.g., L293D) for forward/reverse.
