**Examination Scheme:**  
Continuous Evaluation: 15 Marks  
End-Semester: 35 Marks  

**Course Objectives:**  
- To learn advanced features in C Programming  
- To study advanced data types  
- To understand built-in library functions  

**Course Outcomes:**  
On completion of the course, student will be able to:  
- Write programs using pointers and structures  
- Use Pre-processor directives  
- Manipulate strings using library functions  
- Write programs to perform operations on Files  

**Course Contents**  

## Unit I: Preprocessor (06 Hrs)  
- Concept, Format of preprocessor directives, File inclusion directives (#include), Macro substitution directives (#define), nested macros, parameterized macros,  
- Macros versus functions, #error / #pragma directives, Conditional compilation (#if/#ifdef/#else/#elif/#endif), Predefined macros (_DATE_ / _TIME_ /_FILE_ /_LINE_/ _STDC_)  

## Unit II: Pointers (07 Hrs)  
- Concept – reference & dereference, Declaration, definition, initialization & use, Types of pointers,  
- Pointer Arithmetic, Multiple indirection, parameter passing – call by value and call by reference  
- Arrays & Pointers - Pointer to array, Array of pointers,  
- Functions & pointers - Passing pointer to function, Returning pointer from function, Function pointer, Pointers & const  
- Dynamic memory management, Allocation, Resizing, Releasing, Memory leak / dangling pointers  

## Unit III: Strings (05 Hrs)  
- Concept, Declaration, definition, initialization, format specifiers, String literals/ constants & variables – reading & writing from & to console, Importance of terminating NULL character, Strings & pointers  
- Array of strings & array of character pointers, User defined functions, predefined functions in string.h - strlen, strcpy, strcat, strcmp, strcmpi, strrev, strlwr, strupr, strset, strchr, strrchr, strstr, strncpy, strncat, strncmp, strncmpi, strnset, strtok, Command line arguments – argc and argv  

## Unit IV: Structures (06 Hrs)  
- Concept, Declaration, definition, initialization, accessing structure members (. operator), Array of structures, Pointers to structures, Declaring pointer to structure  
- Accessing structure members via pointer to structure, Structures & functions, Passing each member of structure as a separate argument, Passing structure by value / address  
- Nested structures, typedef & structures, Concept of Union  

## Unit V: File Handling (06 Hrs)  
- Concept of streams, need, Types of files, Operations on text & binary files, Random access file, library functions for file handling – fopen, fclose, fgetc, fseek, fgets, fputc etc
