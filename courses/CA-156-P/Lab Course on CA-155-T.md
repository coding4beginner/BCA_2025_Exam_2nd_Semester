## CA - 156 - P: Laboratory Course Based on CA -155 - T 

**Teaching Scheme:**  
Theory: 04 Hours/Week  
Credits: 02  

**Examination Scheme:**  
Continuous Evaluation: 15 Marks  
End-Semester: 35 Marks  

**Course Objectives:**  
- To learn to apply theoretical concepts of discrete mathematics and statistics to solve problems  
- To provide hands-on experience on R software  

**Course Outcomes:**  
On completion of the course, student will be able to:  
- Demonstrate understanding of fundamental mathematical concepts  
- Apply mathematical and statistical concepts to solve problems  
- Use R software to perform statistical operations and data visualization  

**Guidelines for Instructor's Manual:**  
The instructor shall frame at least 12 assignments. Instructor’s manual consisting of University syllabus, conduction & Assessment guidelines is to be developed.  

**Guidelines for Student Journal:**  
The laboratory assignments are to be submitted by student in the form of journal. Journal consists of Certificate, table of contents, and handwritten write-up for each assignment. Write-up shall include Title, Problem Statement, Date of Completion, etc. For reference one or two journals may be maintained with program prints.  

**Guidelines for Assessment:**  
Continuous assessment of laboratory work is to be carried out based on overall performance of students. For each lab assignment, the instructor will assign grade/marks based on parameters such as timely completion, understanding, neatness etc. with appropriate weightage.
